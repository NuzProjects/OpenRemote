// rule) takes the key and the layer underneath stays open. Without it each
// overlay ran its own window listener for the same press, so one Esc closed
// the whole stack - and in "Manage endpoints" it took a half-written rule
// with it. The stack is plain and tested; the hook binds it to a component.
